Description: This packages provides C++ header files for developers wishing to
    create R packages that processes BAM files. ompBAM automates file access,
	memory management, and handling of multiple threads 'behind the scenes', so
	developers can focus on creating domain-specific functionality. The included
	vignette contains detailed documentation of this API, including quick-start
	instructions to create a new ompBAM-based package, and step-by-step
	explanation of the functionality behind the example packaged included within
	ompBAM.
